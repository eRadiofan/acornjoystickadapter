Joystick Adapter for Acorn Archimedes Computers
===============================================

KiCad project for an Archimedes joystick adapter. Derived from an initial design by **Ian Haylock** that plugs externally into the computers parallel port and enables two Atari style joysticks to be plugged in. Software must be installed on the Archimedes to recognize the adapter, see ``software`` folder. Full details and pictures can be found in this Stardot Forum [thread](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24492). See ``release`` folder for latest version manufcatoring files along with a BOM file.

This fork contains some improvements by Radiofan, including shorter traces, adjustments for (slightly cheaper) connectors, use of 0805 resistors and through-hole capacitors (common stock).
