=============

Orginal **ArcWeld Joystick Adapter** schematic in !Draw format and driver Modules from Ian Haylock. This software and circuit design only seems to exist [here](http://legacy.huber-net.de/Joystick.zip) and is only referenced [here](https://forums.jaspp.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3092#p3092). Unzip this on an Acorn Archimedes using apps such as !SparkFS. It is replicated here just in case that site disappears.

Module 3_31 has been modified to run on an A3000 fitted with 25MHz Arm 3, one additional software delay was added to cope with the slow transition of IO lines. Basic assembly source code is included.
